# Project Wave

## Why
We believe that The Internet can exist and can serve every person in the network also without central servers.
The Wave can help people to take advantage from the common network and to connect to other people without the mediation of a third party company.
Every company has his own interests and priorities, we can have The Services (Cloud storage, File sharing, Web sites, Messages, Transactions and every other internet services) also without them, with the help of everyone.

## What
The Wave is a peer to peer software that runs on the people devices without any central server or any central control.
Data and services flow between people devices to adapt to the needs of everyone like the tide.

## How
Every node is a BitTorrent peer with DHT and is able to detect if the data it stores is also present in enough nodes in the neighborhood. If there are too few nodes with the same data it will upload the data to other nodes to ensure the data availability.
Every chunk of data is encrypted by the client to preserve the privacy.
